kuʔŋga	type of ritual dance			Proper Noun	None	This dance is apparently performed at memorial (funeral) ceremonies by friends/relatives of deceased (?).  Dance has mystic powers?  Some people think that you should not touch people dancing the kuʔŋga.  Superstition also says something like if a kuʔŋga dancer plants a banana tree, the tree will grow very quickly so that the dancer may pick a banana while still dancing... need clarification on all this!	
koŋga	mountain			Noun	None		
ŋaʔŋaʔ	mosquito			Noun	None	Only refers to a specific type/species of mosquito (apparently a kind found in the village, rather than in the city).  Also: informant first provided /moskito/, had to be reminded of the existence of this word

fɛn	forest			Noun	None		
ntʃwɛn	fire wood, wood for burning		ncwɛn	Noun	None		
ndɑmtʃɯ	fruit			Noun	None	Plural.  Something like “tree potatoes”?  Apparently /ndɑm/ is something like sweet potatoes.

nə tɔknsi	to spit			Adjectivalization	None	Literally “to throw spit,” apparently.  In rapid speech sounds more like /tɑɣnsi/. Strange tone pattern for a verb; seems like the last syllable of most verbs is high.  Probably because this is a sort of compound, or maybe /ntsi/ is the object of the verb.

nə kwadə	to think			Verb	None		
nə lamdə	to smell			Verb	None

zəʔə	kidney		zwə’	Noun	None		
tʃunbam	underbelly			Noun	None		
kipʙu	fingernail		nkî̂bbu	Noun	None	CEPOM lists /nkibbu/, which sounds like a plural, as singular “ongle du doigt”.  Is that a mistake on their part or an error by consultant?	
tʃunʙu	elbow		tǔnbu	Noun	None		
djakndʒa	index finger			Noun	None	Idiomatic-- apparently /djaɣə/ means “to find” or “to look at”, and /ndʒa/ means “trouble”, thus this word for index finger refers somehow to a finger that points at or finds trouble.  Consultant says she learned this word as a little girl, but is unsure whether it’s still used.	
mviʔʙu	finger webbing, skin between fingers		mfê’bu	Noun	None		
ndu	intestines		nto	Noun	None	Apparently homophonous with “needle” according to consultant

ləm	blood		ləm	Noun	None		
mvɔk	bones			Noun	None		
zwjak	lungs		zwiɑ̀g	Noun	None	Consultant provided this word for “lungs,” but CEPOM glosses it as “respiration, âme”.  When prompted for “âme” consultant also provided this word.  Also: said /zwjak sɑm/, so that’s its possessor

nzəʔtʃu	brain			Noun	None

ntsi	basket			Noun	None	Minimal tone pair with “spit” /ntsi/

fɔ	give (recent past)			None	None		
ʙu	hand, arm			Noun	None		
kəʒuʔ	deaf			None	None	Seems to be literally “not hear”.  Consultant says /kətʃup/ “mute” (lit. not speak) is a more common word to describe the deaf, since deafness and muteness often co-occur.	
bɔʔ				None	None		
kətʃup	mute (incapable of speech)		kə̀cob	None	None	Consultant says /kətʃup/  is a more common word than /kəʒuʔ/ to describe the deaf, since deafness and muteness often co-occur.	
nfɯmjak	blind		mfʉ̌miɑg	None	None	Consultant says /nfɯ/ means something like “pretend”, and that /nfɯmjak/ means something like “pretend eyes, eyes that give the illusion of having eyes.”	
nə njuʔzwi	to smile		nə̀ nyǔ’ zwì	Verb	None	Odd tones here-- usually verbs end on a high tone.  Possibly a result of this being a compound verb?  Consultant says /nə njuʔu/ is something like “to press something”, so could this have a literal meaning “to suppress laughter”?	
nə njuʔu	to press something, to push something			Verb	None		
nə kwaʔa	to cry		nə̀ kwa’a	Verb	None		
nə sam vɯt	to stretch (one's body or muscles)		nə̀ sǎm wud	Verb	None	Speaker provides first /nə samvɯlɒ/ and then corrects to /nə samvɯt/.  /vɯt/ is apparently “body” or “skin”, looks to be an object of the verb /sam/ “to massage”.  So maybe this is more like “to massage one’s body”?	
nə njit vɯt	to stretch (one's body or muscles)			Verb	None	/vɯt/ is apparently “body” or “skin”, looks to be an object of the verb /njɪt/.  Speaker refers to verb as /nə njɪlə/ “to pull, to stretch” without the /vɯt/.	
nə njilə	to stretch something, to pull something			Verb	None		
nə samɔ	to massage			Verb	None		
nə jaɣə	to yawn		nə̀ yagə	Verb	None		
nə ɣɯtni	to worry (someone), to cause worry			Verb	None

nə ʃuʔu	to be loud, to make a lot of noise			Verb	None	Applications of this word include: water in the ocean, cars, groups of children	
nə kumə	to shave, to peel with a knife			Verb	None	This seems to cover the act of using a tool to remove a layer of something from a surface-- need to get more specifics.  Refers to shaving and also peeling.  This verb covers peeling a potato or carrot, but NOT peeling a banana. If one peels an orange with a knife, it’s /kumɑ̃/, but not if one peels it with hands. Consultant says “it has something to do with the way you hold the knife.”	
nə ʒubə	to peel (with hands)			Verb	None	Refers to peeling something with one’s hands, not a tool.  Examples of things that can be /ʒubə/: orange, banana	
nə liʔi	to move (something), to keep (something)			Verb	None	Received this word when asking what the verb for skinning an animal would be; however, consultant glosses it as “to move something” and also “to keep something”.	
nə bɔʔ tʃu	to braid hair		nə̀ ba’ tu	Verb	None	Looks like bɒʔ “to braid” is taking tʃu “head” as its object here.	
nə bɔʔɔ	to braid, to weave, to knit			Verb	None	This seems to cover braiding hair, braiding plant fibers, weaving, knitting.  Maybe everything wherein fibers are somehow intertwined?	
nə sɔk vɯt	to wash (oneself)		nə̀ sǒg wud	Verb	None	/vɯt/ is apparently “body” or “skin”, looks to be an object of the verb /sɔk/.  	
nə salə	to comb			Verb	None	Refers not only to combing hair, but anything that one uses a comb on, including artificial hair and weaving fibers	
satʃu	comb (noun)			Noun	None	Probably derived from /nə salə/ “to comb” and /tʃu/ “head”	
nə tʃobə	to insult		nə̀ cɑ̂b ncù	Verb	None	Apparently this is one of many words that have the general meaning of “to insult,” but consultant can’t remember any others.  She says this is homophonous (or maybe polysemous?) with a verb /tʃobə/ which means something like “to mash,” which is often used with /mba/, “the fruit which gives palm oil;” if someone says “you /tʃob/ me,” a common response is “no, mə tʃob mba” (“no, I mash the fruit which gives palm oil.”)	
tʃob nʃu	insult (noun)			Noun	None	Literally “insult mouth”?

nə ja ntʃɯ	to be angry		nə̀ ya ntʉ	Verb	None	Lit. “to have pain in the heart”	
nə bɯ tiaŋdə	to be happy			Verb	None	This seems to be a verb /bɯ/ plus the noun for "happiness".  CEPOM lists /nə tsiaŋdə/ for "etre joyeux".	
nə bɯ	to be			Verb	None		
nə ta tʃu	to be stubborn		nə tǎ tu	Verb	None

tatə	lie (noun)		tadtə̀	Noun	None		
nə fɯ	to cheat, to swindle			Verb	None	Hazy semantics here-- example given for this verb was someone who’s paid by the hour and works less than the time they demand payment for.  Maybe related to /nfɯmjak/ “blind”?	
nə lo	to be lazy		nə lɔ	Verb	None		
i				None	None
